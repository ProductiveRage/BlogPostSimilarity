# Automated "Similar Blog Post" suggestions

This is the code that goes alongside my blog posts talking about automating the generation of "you may be interested in" links on my blog.

Part one is here: [Automating "suggested / related posts" links for my blog posts](https://www.productiverage.com/automating-suggested-related-posts-links-for-my-blog-posts) - and the code for it is in the "Similarity" project, see [Program.cs](https://github.com/ProductiveRage/BlogPostSimilarity/blob/main/Similarity/Program.cs).

Part two is here: [Automating "suggested / related posts" links for my blog posts - Part 2](https://www.productiverage.com/automating-suggested-related-posts-links-for-my-blog-posts-part-2) - and the code for it is in the "SimilarityWithTitleTFIDF" project, see [Program.cs](https://github.com/ProductiveRage/BlogPostSimilarity/blob/main/SimilarityWithTitleTFIDF/Program.cs).
